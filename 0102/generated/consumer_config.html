<tr>
<td>bootstrap.servers</td><td>A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping&mdash;this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form <code>host1:port1,host2:port2,...</code>. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).</td><td>list</td><td></td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>key.deserializer</td><td>Deserializer class for key that implements the <code>Deserializer</code> interface.</td><td>class</td><td></td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>value.deserializer</td><td>Deserializer class for value that implements the <code>Deserializer</code> interface.</td><td>class</td><td></td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>fetch.min.bytes</td><td>The minimum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. If insufficient data is available the request will wait for that much data to accumulate before answering the request. The default setting of 1 byte means that fetch requests are answered as soon as a single byte of data is available or the fetch request times out waiting for data to arrive. Setting this to something greater than 1 will cause the server to wait for larger amounts of data to accumulate which can improve server throughput a bit at the cost of some additional latency.</td><td>int</td><td>1</td><td>[0,...]</td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>group.id</td><td>A unique string that identifies the consumer group this consumer belongs to. This property is required if the consumer uses either the group management functionality by using <code>subscribe(topic)</code> or the Kafka-based offset management strategy.</td><td>string</td><td>""</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>heartbeat.interval.ms</td><td>The expected time between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using Kafka's group management facilities. Heartbeats are used to ensure that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the group. The value must be set lower than <code>session.timeout.ms</code>, but typically should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances.</td><td>int</td><td>3000</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>max.partition.fetch.bytes</td><td>The maximum amount of data per-partition the server will return. If the first message in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this limit, the message will still be returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. The maximum message size accepted by the broker is defined via <code>message.max.bytes</code> (broker config) or <code>max.message.bytes</code> (topic config). See fetch.max.bytes for limiting the consumer request size.</td><td>int</td><td>1048576</td><td>[0,...]</td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>session.timeout.ms</td><td>The timeout used to detect consumer failures when using Kafka's group management facility. The consumer sends periodic heartbeats to indicate its liveness to the broker. If no heartbeats are received by the broker before the expiration of this session timeout, then the broker will remove this consumer from the group and initiate a rebalance. Note that the value must be in the allowable range as configured in the broker configuration by <code>group.min.session.timeout.ms</code> and <code>group.max.session.timeout.ms</code>.</td><td>int</td><td>10000</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>ssl.truststore.location</td><td>The location of the trust store file. </td><td>string</td><td>null</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ssl.truststore.password</td><td>The password for the trust store file. </td><td>password</td><td>null</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>fetch.max.bytes</td><td>The maximum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. This is not an absolute maximum, if the first message in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value, the message will still be returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. The maximum message size accepted by the broker is defined via <code>message.max.bytes</code> (broker config) or <code>max.message.bytes</code> (topic config). Note that the consumer performs multiple fetches in parallel.</td><td>int</td><td>52428800</td><td>[0,...]</td><td>medium</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>max.poll.interval.ms</td><td>The maximum delay between invocations of poll() when using consumer group management. This places an upper bound on the amount of time that the consumer can be idle before fetching more records. If poll() is not called before expiration of this timeout, then the consumer is considered failed and the group will rebalance in order to reassign the partitions to another member. </td><td>int</td><td>300000</td><td>[1,...]</td><td>medium</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>max.poll.records</td><td>The maximum number of records returned in a single call to poll().</td><td>int</td><td>500</td><td>[1,...]</td><td>medium</td></tr>

<td>receive.buffer.bytes</td><td>The size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to use when reading data. If the value is -1, the OS default will be used.</td><td>int</td><td>65536</td><td>[-1,...]</td><td>medium</td></tr>
