<div class="block">A client that consumes records from a Kafka cluster using a share group.
 <p>
     <em>This is an early access feature under development which is introduced by KIP-932.
     It is not suitable for production use until it is fully implemented and released.</em>

 <h3>Cross-Version Compatibility</h3>
 This client can communicate with brokers that are a version that supports share groups. You will receive an
 <a href="../../common/errors/UnsupportedVersionException.html" title="class in org.apache.kafka.common.errors"><code>UnsupportedVersionException</code></a> when invoking an API that is not
 available on the running broker version.

 <h3><a name="sharegroups">Share Groups and Topic Subscriptions</a></h3>
 Kafka uses the concept of <i>share groups</i> to allow a pool of consumers to cooperate on the work of
 consuming and processing records. All consumer instances sharing the same <code>group.id</code> will be part of
 the same share group.
 <p>
 Each consumer in a group can dynamically set the list of topics it wants to subscribe to using the
 <a href="#subscribe(java.util.Collection)"><code>subscribe(Collection)</code></a> method. Kafka will deliver each message in the subscribed topics to one
 consumer in the share group. Unlike consumer groups, share groups balance the partitions between all
 members of the share group permitting multiple consumers to consume from the same partitions. This gives
 more flexible sharing of records than a consumer group, at the expense of record ordering.
 <p>
 Membership in a share group is maintained dynamically: if a consumer fails, the partitions assigned to
 it will be reassigned to other consumers in the same group. Similarly, if a new consumer joins the group,
 the partition assignment is re-evaluated and partitions can be moved from existing consumers to the new one.
 This is known as <i>rebalancing</i> the group and is discussed in more detail <a href="#failures">below</a>.
 Group rebalancing is also used when new partitions are added to one of the subscribed topics. The group will
 automatically detect the new partitions through periodic metadata refreshes and assign them to the members of the group.
 <p>
 Conceptually, you can think of a share group as a single logical subscriber made up of multiple consumers.
 In fact, in other messaging systems, a share group is roughly equivalent to a <em>durable shared subscription</em>.
 You can have multiple share groups and consumer groups independently consuming from the same topics.

 <h3><a name="failures">Detecting Consumer Failures</a></h3>
 After subscribing to a set of topics, the consumer will automatically join the group when <a href="#poll(java.time.Duration)"><code>poll(Duration)</code></a> is
 invoked. This method is designed to ensure consumer liveness. As long as you continue to call poll, the consumer
 will stay in the group and continue to receive records from the partitions it was assigned. Under the covers,
 the consumer sends periodic heartbeats to the broker. If the consumer crashes or is unable to send heartbeats for
 the duration of the share group's session time-out, then the consumer will be considered dead and its partitions
 will be reassigned.
 <p>
 It is also possible that the consumer could encounter a "livelock" situation where it is continuing to send heartbeats
 in the background, but no progress is being made. To prevent the consumer from holding onto its partitions
 indefinitely in this case, we provide a liveness detection mechanism using the <code>max.poll.interval.ms</code> setting.
 If you don't call poll at least as frequently as this, the client will proactively leave the share group.
 So to stay in the group, you must continue to call poll.

 <h3>Record Delivery and Acknowledgement</h3>
 When a consumer in a share-group fetches records using <a href="#poll(java.time.Duration)"><code>poll(Duration)</code></a>, it receives available records from any
 of the topic-partitions that match its subscriptions. Records are acquired for delivery to this consumer with a
 time-limited acquisition lock. While a record is acquired, it is not available for another consumer. By default,
 the lock duration is 30 seconds, but it can also be controlled using the group <code>group.share.record.lock.duration.ms</code>
 configuration parameter. The idea is that the lock is automatically released once the lock duration has elapsed, and
 then the record is available to be given to another consumer. The consumer which holds the lock can deal with it in
 the following ways:
 <ul>
     <li>The consumer can acknowledge successful processing of the record</li>
     <li>The consumer can release the record, which makes the record available for another delivery attempt</li>
     <li>The consumer can reject the record, which indicates that the record is unprocessable and does not make
     the record available for another delivery attempt</li>
     <li>The consumer can do nothing, in which case the lock is automatically released when the lock duration has elapsed</li>
 </ul>
 The cluster limits the number of records acquired for consumers for each topic-partition in a share group. Once the limit
 is reached, fetching records will temporarily yield no further records until the number of acquired records reduces,
 as naturally happens when the locks time out. This limit is controlled by the broker configuration property
 <code>group.share.record.lock.partition.limit</code>. By limiting the duration of the acquisition lock and automatically
 releasing the locks, the broker ensures delivery progresses even in the presence of consumer failures.
 <p>
 The consumer can choose to use implicit or explicit acknowledgement of the records it processes.
 <p>If the application calls <a href="#acknowledge(org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord,org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.AcknowledgeType)"><code>acknowledge(ConsumerRecord, AcknowledgeType)</code></a> for any record in the batch,
 it is using <em>explicit acknowledgement</em>. In this case:
 <ul>
     <li>The application calls <a href="#commitSync()"><code>commitSync()</code></a> or <a href="#commitAsync()"><code>commitAsync()</code></a> which commits the acknowledgements to Kafka.
     If any records in the batch were not acknowledged, they remain acquired and will be presented to the application
     in response to a future poll.</li>
     <li>The application calls <a href="#poll(java.time.Duration)"><code>poll(Duration)</code></a> without committing first, which commits the acknowledgements to
     Kafka asynchronously. In this case, no exception is thrown by a failure to commit the acknowledgement.
     If any records in the batch were not acknowledged, they remain acquired and will be presented to the application
     in response to a future poll.</li>
     <li>The application calls <a href="#close()"><code>close()</code></a> which attempts to commit any pending acknowledgements and
     releases any remaining acquired records.</li>
 </ul>
 If the application does not call <a href="#acknowledge(org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord,org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.AcknowledgeType)"><code>acknowledge(ConsumerRecord, AcknowledgeType)</code></a> for any record in the batch,
 it is using <em>implicit acknowledgement</em>. In this case:
 <ul>
     <li>The application calls <a href="#commitSync()"><code>commitSync()</code></a> or <a href="#commitAsync()"><code>commitAsync()</code></a> which implicitly acknowledges all of
     the delivered records as processed successfully and commits the acknowledgements to Kafka.</li>
     <li>The application calls <a href="#poll(java.time.Duration)"><code>poll(Duration)</code></a> without committing, which also implicitly acknowledges all of
     the delivered records and commits the acknowledgements to Kafka asynchronously. In this case, no exception is
     thrown by a failure to commit the acknowledgements.</li>
     <li>The application calls <a href="#close()"><code>close()</code></a>  which releases any acquired records without acknowledgement.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 The consumer guarantees that the records returned in the <code>ConsumerRecords</code> object for a specific topic-partition
 are in order of increasing offset. For each topic-partition, Kafka guarantees that acknowledgements for the records
 in a batch are performed atomically. This makes error handling significantly more straightforward because there can be
 one error code per partition.

 <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 The share consumer APIs offer flexibility to cover a variety of consumption use cases. Here are some examples to
 demonstrate how to use them.

 <h4>Acknowledging a batch of records (implicit acknowledgement)</h4>
 This example demonstrates implicit acknowledgement using <a href="#poll(java.time.Duration)"><code>poll(Duration)</code></a> to acknowledge the records which
 were delivered in the previous poll. All the records delivered are implicitly marked as successfully consumed and
 acknowledged synchronously with Kafka as the consumer fetches more records.
 <pre>
     Properties props = new Properties();
     props.setProperty(&quot;bootstrap.servers&quot;, &quot;localhost:9092&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;group.id&quot;, &quot;test&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;key.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;value.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
     KafkaShareConsumer&lt;String, String&gt; consumer = new KafkaShareConsumer&lt;&gt;(props);
     consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(&quot;foo&quot;));
     while (true) {
         ConsumerRecords&lt;String, String&gt; records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
         for (ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt; record : records) {
             System.out.printf(&quot;offset = %d, key = %s, value = %s%n&quot;, record.offset(), record.key(), record.value());
             doProcessing(record);
         }
     }
 </pre>

 Alternatively, you can use <a href="#commitSync()"><code>commitSync()</code></a> or <a href="#commitAsync()"><code>commitAsync()</code></a> to commit the acknowledgements, but this is
 slightly less efficient because there is an additional request sent to Kafka.
 <pre>
     Properties props = new Properties();
     props.setProperty(&quot;bootstrap.servers&quot;, &quot;localhost:9092&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;group.id&quot;, &quot;test&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;key.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;value.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
     KafkaShareConsumer&lt;String, String&gt; consumer = new KafkaShareConsumer&lt;&gt;(props);
     consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(&quot;foo&quot;));
     while (true) {
         ConsumerRecords&lt;String, String&gt; records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
         for (ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt; record : records) {
             System.out.printf(&quot;offset = %d, key = %s, value = %s%n&quot;, record.offset(), record.key(), record.value());
             doProcessing(record);
         }
         consumer.commitSync();
     }
 </pre>

 <h4>Per-record acknowledgement (explicit acknowledgement)</h4>
 This example demonstrates using different acknowledgement types depending on the outcome of processing the records.
 <pre>
     Properties props = new Properties();
     props.setProperty(&quot;bootstrap.servers&quot;, &quot;localhost:9092&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;group.id&quot;, &quot;test&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;key.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;value.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
     KafkaShareConsumer&lt;String, String&gt; consumer = new KafkaShareConsumer&lt;&gt;(props);
     consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(&quot;foo&quot;));
     while (true) {
         ConsumerRecords&lt;String, String&gt; records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
         for (ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt; record : records) {
             try {
                 doProcessing(record);
                 consumer.acknowledge(record, AcknowledgeType.ACCEPT);
             } catch (Exception e) {
                 consumer.acknowledge(record, AcknowledgeType.REJECT);
             }
         }
         consumer.commitSync();
     }
 </pre>

 Each record processed is separately acknowledged using a call to <a href="#acknowledge(org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord,org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.AcknowledgeType)"><code>acknowledge(ConsumerRecord, AcknowledgeType)</code></a>.
 The <a href="AcknowledgeType.html" title="enum class in org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer"><code>AcknowledgeType</code></a> argument indicates whether the record was processed successfully or not. In this case,
 the bad records are rejected meaning that they’re not eligible for further delivery attempts. For a permanent error
 such as a semantic error, this is appropriate. For a transient error which might not affect a subsequent processing
 attempt, <a href="AcknowledgeType.html#RELEASE"><code>AcknowledgeType.RELEASE</code></a> is more appropriate because the record remains eligible for further delivery attempts.
 <p>
 The calls to <a href="#acknowledge(org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord,org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.AcknowledgeType)"><code>acknowledge(ConsumerRecord, AcknowledgeType)</code></a> are simply updating local information in the consumer.
 It is only once <a href="#commitSync()"><code>commitSync()</code></a> is called that the acknowledgements are committed by sending the new state
 information to Kafka.

 <h4>Per-record acknowledgement, ending processing of the batch on an error (explicit acknowledgement)</h4>
 This example demonstrates ending processing of a batch of records on the first error.
 <pre>
     Properties props = new Properties();
     props.setProperty(&quot;bootstrap.servers&quot;, &quot;localhost:9092&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;group.id&quot;, &quot;test&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;key.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
     props.setProperty(&quot;value.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer&quot;);
     KafkaShareConsumer&lt;String, String&gt; consumer = new KafkaShareConsumer&lt;&gt;(props);
     consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(&quot;foo&quot;));
     while (true) {
         ConsumerRecords&lt;String, String&gt; records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
         for (ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt; record : records) {
             try {
                 doProcessing(record);
                 consumer.acknowledge(record, AcknowledgeType.ACCEPT);
             } catch (Exception e) {
                 consumer.acknowledge(record, AcknowledgeType.REJECT);
                 break;
             }
         }
         consumer.commitSync();
     }
 </pre>
 There are the following cases in this example:
 <ol>
     <li>The batch contains no records, in which case the application just polls again. The call to <a href="#commitSync()"><code>commitSync()</code></a>
     just does nothing because the batch was empty.</li>
     <li>All of the records in the batch are processed successfully. The calls to <a href="#acknowledge(org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord,org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.AcknowledgeType)"><code>acknowledge(ConsumerRecord, AcknowledgeType)</code></a>
     specifying <code>AcknowledgeType.ACCEPT</code> mark all records in the batch as successfully processed.</li>
     <li>One of the records encounters an exception. The call to <a href="#acknowledge(org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord,org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.AcknowledgeType)"><code>acknowledge(ConsumerRecord, AcknowledgeType)</code></a> specifying
     <code>AcknowledgeType.REJECT</code> rejects that record. Earlier records in the batch have already been marked as successfully
     processed. The call to <a href="#commitSync()"><code>commitSync()</code></a> commits the acknowledgements, but the records after the failed record
     remain acquired as part of the same delivery attempt and will be presented to the application in response to another poll.</li>
 </ol>

 <h3>Reading Transactional Records</h3>
 The way that share groups handle transactional records is controlled by the <code>group.share.isolation.level</code></code>
 configuration property. In a share group, the isolation level applies to the entire share group, not just individual
 consumers.
 <p>
 In <code>read_uncommitted</code> isolation level, the share group consumes all non-transactional and transactional
 records. The consumption is bounded by the high-water mark.
 <p>
 In <code>read_committed</code> isolation level (not yet supported), the share group only consumes non-transactional
 records and committed transactional records. The set of records which are eligible to become in-flight records are
 non-transactional records and committed transactional records only. The consumption is bounded by the last stable
 offset, so an open transaction blocks the progress of the share group with read_committed isolation level.

 <h3><a name="multithreaded">Multithreaded Processing</a></h3>
 The consumer is NOT thread-safe. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that multithreaded access
 is properly synchronized. Unsynchronized access will result in <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html" title="class or interface in java.util" class="external-link"><code>ConcurrentModificationException</code></a>.
 <p>
 The only exception to this rule is <a href="#wakeup()"><code>wakeup()</code></a> which can safely be used from an external thread to
 interrupt an active operation. In this case, a <a href="../../common/errors/WakeupException.html" title="class in org.apache.kafka.common.errors"><code>WakeupException</code></a> will be
 thrown from the thread blocking on the operation. This can be used to shut down the consumer from another thread.
 The following snippet shows the typical pattern:

 <pre>
 public class KafkaShareConsumerRunner implements Runnable {
     private final AtomicBoolean closed = new AtomicBoolean(false);
     private final KafkaShareConsumer consumer;

     public KafkaShareConsumerRunner(KafkaShareConsumer consumer) {
       this.consumer = consumer;
     }

     @Override
     public void run() {
         try {
             consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList("topic"));
             while (!closed.get()) {
                 ConsumerRecords records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(10000));
                 // Handle new records
             }
         } catch (WakeupException e) {
             // Ignore exception if closing
             if (!closed.get()) throw e;
         } finally {
             consumer.close();
         }
     }

     // Shutdown hook which can be called from a separate thread
     public void shutdown() {
         closed.set(true);
         consumer.wakeup();
     }
 }
 </pre>

 Then in a separate thread, the consumer can be shutdown by setting the closed flag and waking up the consumer.
 <pre>
     closed.set(true);
     consumer.wakeup();
 </pre>

 <p>
 Note that while it is possible to use thread interrupts instead of <a href="#wakeup()"><code>wakeup()</code></a> to abort a blocking operation
 (in which case, <a href="../../common/errors/InterruptException.html" title="class in org.apache.kafka.common.errors"><code>InterruptException</code></a> will be raised), we discourage their use since they may cause a clean
 shutdown of the consumer to be aborted. Interrupts are mainly supported for those cases where using <a href="#wakeup()"><code>wakeup()</code></a>
 is impossible, such as when a consumer thread is managed by code that is unaware of the Kafka client.
 <p>
 We have intentionally avoided implementing a particular threading model for processing. Various options for
 multithreaded processing are possible, of which the most straightforward is to dedicate a thread to each consumer.</div>

<div class="block">Determines the client's unique client instance ID used for telemetry. This ID is unique to
 this specific client instance and will not change after it is initially generated.
 The ID is useful for correlating client operations with telemetry sent to the broker and
 to its eventual monitoring destinations.
 <p>
 If telemetry is enabled, this will first require a connection to the cluster to generate
 the unique client instance ID. This method waits up to <code>timeout</code> for the consumer
 client to complete the request.
 <p>
 Client telemetry is controlled by the <a href="ConsumerConfig.html#ENABLE_METRICS_PUSH_CONFIG"><code>ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_METRICS_PUSH_CONFIG</code></a>
 configuration option.</div>
