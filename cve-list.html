      <p> This CVE identifies a vulnerability in snappy-java which could be used to cause an Out-of-Memory (OOM) condition, leading to Denial-of-Service(DoS) on the Kafka broker.
          The vulnerability allows any user who can producer data to the broker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a malicious payload in the record which is compressed using snappy. For more details on the vulnerability, please refer to the following
          link: <a href="https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-qcwq-55hx-v3vh">snappy-java GitHub advisory.</a>

      <p>A possible security vulnerability has been identified in Apache Kafka Connect API.
        This requires access to a Kafka Connect worker, and the ability to create/modify connectors on it with an arbitrary Kafka client SASL JAAS config
        and a SASL-based security protocol, which has been possible on Kafka Connect clusters since Apache Kafka 2.3.0. This will allow to perform JNDI requests
        that result in Denial of service/remote code execution.

            This will allow the server to connect to the attacker's LDAP server and deserialize the LDAP response, which the attacker can use
            to execute java deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server. Attacker can cause unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data

            client override policy that permits them.<br>

            Since Apache Kafka 3.4.0, we have added a system property ("-Dorg.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules") to disable the problematic login modules usage
            in SASL JAAS configuration. Also by default "com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule" is disabled in Apache Kafka 3.4.0.<br>

            We advise the Kafka Connect users to validate connector configurations and only allow trusted JNDI configurations. Also examine connector dependencies for
            vulnerable versions and either upgrade their connectors, upgrading that specific dependency, or removing the connectors as options for remediation. Finally,
            in addition to leveraging the "org.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules" system property, Kafka Connect users can also implement their own connector
            client config override policy, which can be used to control which Kafka client properties can be overridden directly in a connector config and which cannot.<br>
