		<h3>Community support</h3>

		<p>
			This is an open source project so the amount of time community members have available to help resolve your issue
			is often limited as help is provided on a volunteer basis from
			<a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works/#hats" target="_blank">individuals</a>.
			However, it is free, and you are often able to discuss issues with the developers who actually wrote the code
			you are running.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are encountering a problem by using Apache Kafka then you can send an email to the <a href="mailto:users@kafka.apache.org">users@kafka.apache.org</a> mailing list.
			You need follow the subscribe instructions before sending email from the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/contact">contact us</a> page.
			If you’re fairly certain you’re hitting a bug please report it via our <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/KAFKA">issue trackers</a>.
			Be sure to review the tickets list and read the documentation carefully as they contain tips and tricks about working with Apache communities in general and
			Apache Kafka in particular.
		</p>

		<h3>Commercial support</h3>
		<p>
			Apache Kafka is a widely used project. As such, several companies have built products and services around Apache Kafka.
			This page is dedicated to providing descriptions of those offerings and links to more information.
			Companies are definitely encouraged to update this page directly or send a mail to the Apache Kafka PMC with a description
			of your offerings, and we can update the page. The products and services listed on this page are provided for
			information use only to our users. The Apache Kafka PMC does not endorse or recommend any of the products or services
			on this page. See below for information about what is appropriate to add to the page.

				for Apache Kafka and related projects like Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Camel, Apache Karaf.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Policy for additions to this page</h3>

		<p>
			Companies are free to add information about their products and services to this page (please keep entries in
			alphabetical order). The information must be factual and informational in nature and not be a marketing statement.
			Statements that promote your products and services over other offerings on the page will not be tolerated and
			will be removed. Such marketing statements can be added to your own pages on your own site, but not here.
			When in doubt, email the Apache Kafka dev list (see <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/contact">Mailing Lists</a>) and ask. We’d be happy to help.
