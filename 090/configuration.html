Kafka uses key-value pairs in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties">property file format</a> for configuration. These values can be supplied either from a file or programmatically.

<h3><a id="brokerconfigs" href="#brokerconfigs">3.1 Broker Configs</a></h3>

The essential configurations are the following:
<ul>
    <li><code>broker.id</code>
    <li><code>log.dirs</code>
    <li><code>zookeeper.connect</code>
</ul>

Topic-level configurations and defaults are discussed in more detail <a href="#topic-config">below</a>.

<!--#include virtual="kafka_config.html" -->

<p>More details about broker configuration can be found in the scala class <code>kafka.server.KafkaConfig</code>.</p>

<a id="topic-config" href="#topic-config">Topic-level configuration</a>

Configurations pertinent to topics have both a global default as well an optional per-topic override. If no per-topic configuration is given the global default is used. The override can be set at topic creation time by giving one or more <code>--config</code> options. This example creates a topic named <i>my-topic</i> with a custom max message size and flush rate:
<pre>
<b> &gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic my-topic --partitions 1
        --replication-factor 1 --config max.message.bytes=64000 --config flush.messages=1</b>
</pre>
Overrides can also be changed or set later using the alter topic command. This example updates the max message size for <i>my-topic</i>:
<pre>
<b> &gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --topic my-topic
    --config max.message.bytes=128000</b>
</pre>

To remove an override you can do
<pre>
<b> &gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --topic my-topic
    --deleteConfig max.message.bytes</b>
</pre>

The following are the topic-level configurations. The server's default configuration for this property is given under the Server Default Property heading, setting this default in the server config allows you to change the default given to topics that have no override specified.

      When used together, min.insync.replicas and request.required.acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce with request.required.acks of -1.
